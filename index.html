        <h3>Meatballs</h3>
        <p>One time I wanted to make some spaghetti and meatballs. I thought this recipe looked interesting because it required soaking the bread crumbs in milk. They can be cooked either by baking or boiling in a sauce. Both ways are delicious</p>
        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
          <li>1/2 cup fine breadcrumbs</li>
          <li>1 large egg</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
          <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
          <li>1/4 cup finely minced Italian parsley</li>
          <li>450g mince</li>
          <li>1/2 cup or 1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
          <li>1 clove garlic, finely minced</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Method</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Pour the milk over the breadcrumbs in a small bowl and set aside while preparing the rest of the meatball mix. The breadcrumbs will absorb the milk and become soggy.</li>
          <li>Whisk the egg in a large bowl until blended. Whisk in the salt and a generous quantity of black pepper, then whisk in the Parmesan and parsley.</li>
          <li>Add the meat to the egg mixture. Use your hands to thoroughly mix the egg into the ground meat.</li>
          <li>Add the onions, garlic, and soaked breadcrumbs to the meat. Mix them thoroughly into the meat with your fingers. Try not to overwork the meat; pinch the meat between your fingers rather than kneading it.</li>
          <li>Pinch off a piece of the meat mixture and gently roll between your hands to form 4cm meatballs. Continue shaping until all the meat is used.</li>
          <li>
            <ul>
              <li>To bake the meatballs: Arrange the meatballs spaced slightly apart on a baking sheet. Cook under the broiler for 20 to 25 minutes or bake at 200°C for 25 to 30 minutes. (Watch closely if cooking meatballs made with lean meat.) The meatballs are done when cooked through and the outsides are browned, and when they register 70°C in the middle on an instant read thermometer.</li>
              <li>To cook the meatballs in sauce: Bring a marinara sauce or other pasta sauce to a simmer and add as many meatballs as will fit comfortably in the pan. Cover and simmer for 30 to 35 minutes. The meatballs are done when they're cooked through and register 70°C in the middle on an instant read thermometer.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Serve immediately.</li>

        <h3>Spinach Curry</h3>
        <p>I saw this spinach curry being prepared on the TV one afternoon. I decided to record the recipe as I thought it looked like a simple and tasty meal to make. It takes some time to make, but it is worth it.</p>
        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
          <li>400g spinach</li>
          <li>1/2 cup water </li>
          <li>150g chickpeas</li>
          <li>1 1/2 onions, finely chopped (300g)</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon garlic, finely minced</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon ginger, finely minced</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons curry powder</li>
          <li>400g can of tomato </li>
          <li>40g butter</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Method</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Blanch the spinach in boiling water, cut roughly before blending into a paste. Put to one side.</li>
          <li>Heat oil in a pot, then add the garlic and ginger. Once they become aromatic, add the onion and salt. Cover and cook for 10-15 minutes.</li>
          <li>Remove the lid and add the canned tomato and curry powder. Simmer off any liquid until the mixture doesn't slide back into position when pushed to the side of the pot.</li>
          <li>Add the spinach paste, chickpeas, and worcestershire sauce. Bring back the curry back to a simmer and then add the butter, letting it melt.</li>
          <li>Serve with bread or rice.</li>
        </ol>
