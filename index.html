    <h2>Hi! I'm Michael, an aspiring web developer. </h2>
    <h3>A new path</h3>
    <p>Having spent the last eight years as an English language teacher in Japan, I started looking for a new challenge as I planned to move back to Australia. I started looking into web development after talking to a long time friend about possible career paths. At first I was intimidated by the idea of learning how to program. How could I make such a drastic career change this late in my life? But after doing some research and considering my strengths, I realised that maybe I do have what it takes.</p>
    <h3>Language background</h3>
    <p>One of my majors at university was Japanese Language, which I have continue to use and improve everyday. I feel that I am able to communicate effectively in a language with quite different grammar to English. I need to be able to take what I want to say and rearrange it to fit the syntax of Japanese. More over, as a teacher of English I need to be able communicate complex ideas in the most concise and understandable way possible. While I computer may not think the same way as a person, I feel that these skills will help to tell it what I want to do. </p>
    <h3>Deconstructing and solving</h3>
    <p>I have always enjoyed trying to figure out the way things work. When I was I child I used to take apart my toys to see how they worked. I quickly learned that being able to deconstruct something was of no use if you couldn't put it back together. If something was broken I would take it apart to see if I could find away to make it work again. One of the best feelings is encountering a problem and figuring out a good solution.</p>
    <h3>First steps</h3>
    <p>When I started getting into web development, I read Chris Pine's<a href="https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/"> 'Learn to Program'</a> to learn the fundamentals of a programming language, Ruby. Next I began working through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">'The Odin Project'</a>, which introduced me to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. As I'm working full time, it's been slow going and I know I still have lots to learn. But I'm enjoying the journey and it's been really interesting learning how to create.</p>
    <h3>Where to next</h3>
    <p>I am currently living and working in Nagoya, Japan, though will be moving back to Austraila in March 2018. I plan to focus on learning web development fulltime, undertaking the <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive">Web Development Intensive</a> Bootcamp offered by General Assembly in Melbourne. </p>
